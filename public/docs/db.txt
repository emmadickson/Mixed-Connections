Julia Garner Lookalike - m4w - missed connections *** We were both waiting to cross Park Avenue South at 18th Street this morning around 10:15 AM. Both headed east. We made eye contact for a moment. You were wearing a long tweed jacket, jeans rolled up at the bottom, very blonde hair tied in a scarf and look a little like the actress, Julia Garner. You looked artsy and fun and I would really enjoy hearing from you. *** d4d974a1645e9865668e9edccf82c254

Greencard - Stay in the USA - Don't let Trump Deport You! - m4w - missed connections *** Looking for Commitment - Let's Get Married!!! Don't Spend Another Day as a Single Woman! Let's see what we can do about that! I'm NOT looking for a one night'er or a fling, but rather a meaningful relationship. Based on Openness, Trust and Honesty. I would LOVE to be MARRIED by the Valentine's Day next year - 2018. Let's Spend the Weekends Together, Spooning and Cuddling, So let's Do This - Let's Get a Ring on That Finger you can show to your Friends and Family - And if you want to start for a little one soon thereafter. I have a decent job, I'm 39 year old straight guy, 5'10, Caucasian, Green Eyes, decent looking, desires children, emotionally stable, don't smoke, don't drink (except maybe socially). Traveled to Europe, Central America, Bermuda, Caribbean, Middle East - saw all three of the major World's religions holiest places. Traveling to Rural North Africa last year I was interrogated by the local police to make sure "The American was safe and no harm came to me." I even had to sign a document in the local governmental office stating what happened to me in Rural North Africa - which was nothing but amazing, very religious and humble people. Also the food was incredibly fresh and of course tasty - especially when all the meals were served in one pot, for everyone with no serving spoons or even utensils. I even deliberately chased Tornadoes and even went into the eye of a Hurricane (once was enough - and yes I was scared). Luckily I survived and I am able to tell the tale. I so want to get to know YOU, to HONOR YOU and so want to be in LOVE. Let's start this beautiful Journey together - Holding Hands. I hope you answer me soon my Love - Time Waits For No Man or Woman. Time is Precious - Let's Do This Now! Please Send a Pic so I know who I am talking To : ) Contact me soon - don't let another day become wasted! Carpe Diem - Seize The Day! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE! Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night. Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night. Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Dylan Thomas (October 27, 1914 - November 9, 1953) --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *** b5cc479046a0456b6f65f123a2827304
