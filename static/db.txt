Wanted to speak to you after class. Waited in hall for a bit, but never saw you leave. Nice trick! Batgirl ropes? Hope this means you will again be a regular. *** 8b960fa4f723c3119b2ec1d842c29baf*** Location: newyork *** Time: 2017-10-01", "White Male, Light Brown Hair, Green Eyes, Irish Pub Manhattan - w4m - missed connections *** We met at Jack Doyle's Irish pub in midtown Manhattan. I was sitting at the bar with one of my girlfriends. You approached me and asked if you could buy me a drink. You were there with two friends. One was taller than you and bald. The other one was muscular with dark brown hair and a beard. Unfortunately, we never had the chance to actually have a drink with each other even though I really would have loved to get to know you but I was too shy to talk to you and also seeing someone at that time. I really regret not even having asked for your name. You're a kind and handsome man with light brown hair and green eyes. I'm a blonde German girl with green eyes. I know it's crazy after all this time but I'd love to get a second chance at getting to know you if you are interested. *** 98dd5c9aee3f6043456c8c4c6bdfaa3e*** Location: raleigh *** Time: 2017-10-01", "Path train with each other then... - m4m - missed connections *** So you got on the path a few stops after and I definitely caught you staring a few times, you got out before me (but looked like you wanted to follow me), and then when we were passing on the street you didn't follow me. Let me know what sweatshirt you were wearing and let's have some fun. PS saw you vaping on the path too lol *** 40eace456a1bb62d746a64e5e376bdb1*** Location: raleigh *** Time: 2017-10-01", "Walmart tonight - m4w - missed connections *** You were in self checkout in front of me tonight but followed me out.

There were some other people in there, but I could tell that we had a strong connection. We kept making eye contact and I wanted so badly to break the tension and say something when we were alone, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I had a tan towel wrapped around my waist and you were tall and wore glasses. I'd love to meet up there again sometime.... I've never done this before, but I really hope you see this...If you think this is you, respond and tell me what you were carrying when you walked into the steam room, and/or how many guys were in there with me when you entered. *** 7c32afa7a2f94a887e67be3f85c4cefa*** Location: pittsburgh *** Time: 2017-10-01", "Straight Married chubby Tan Daddy on Norwegian Gem - m4m - missed connections *** We never were able to make a connection because your wife was with you the entire time, but you winked at my boyfriend in the casino.. I was only able to wave to you and talk shortly in the elevator but you had a nice body sexy belly, nice juicy ass. We were both on the 7 day to Canada leaving NY Port on the 23rd on the NCL Gem. Would love to at least have a chat with you. *** 934b76e4b82e5c2a630eb2eae02b8eeb*** Location: raleigh *** Time: 2017-10-01", "When A Friendship Dies (Future Missed Connection) - m4m - missed connections *** Well, today I found an old ticket stub from a concert we went to a few years ago. It brought back memories of that night and I chuckled to myself. The moment soon passed and I realized that our friendship ended years ago. I finally have to accept the fact that our friendship is over, and won't likely be resuscitated. Sometimes friendships just run their course for whatever reason. I had an urge to reach out to you when I heard your father had passed away, but then thought it would be too disingenuous so I just put your name in the 'prayer pot' at my church. My life is so different now, and I realize that it's time to move onto the next phase. Middle age has been brutal, and I don't expect anyone to come along with me for the ride, though it would be cool to have you by my side right now as the old universe crumbles into a new one. When a friendship dies, where does all that love go off to? It has to go somewhere. *** a10d1c0ef8f6f0cb04ceca0c07391e87*** Location: pittsburgh *** Time: 2017-10-01", "Pressed - missed connections *** February 3, 2015:No writing tonight.
