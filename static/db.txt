Despite your hope, I am not well. It has nothing to do with you. Was there an actual reason you messaged me that day? I see no point in responding if only to exchange pleasantries and well wishes. We've known ourselves far too long for such pedantics. Unless your situation has changed we're just digging up the past without having a future.

I don't think I have ever had as much fun with someone I had never before met as I had with you last evening. I discovered vegetarian food can be amazing;  I continue to suck at pool; some people have a borderline unhealthy obsession with Rihanna; there are younger people who actually know of Pat Benatar; and that I am the biggest dipshit alive for failing to ask for your contact information. I guess I was just afraid of the looming disappointment promised by the transient nature of your visit to Raleigh. You seem like a genuinely awesome girl and I would have really loved getting to know you. I really did/do want to read your poetry. You read my card well. Thanks for an enjoyable time. P.S.

That unsettled feeling of being out in the open without a shield, without a place to duck and cover. The panic starts on my upper back - creeping up and over the shoulder blades, moving around the rib cage and along the sides of my abdomen. Here on the Finland walkway, it's a wide open, 360-degree view, yet I find the ability to see anything and everything fear-inducing instead of calming. I can see, but I can also be seen. I want to leave immediately, but instead, I bite down hard on those anxious feelings and jump up and down, spinning like a top, arms wide, marveling at the blue sky above me. I will not be afraid. I will generate a sense of freedom and perspective that only comes when my heart, my eyes, my soul are completely open and exposed.~ mis.steps *** 330c6fb2856457805ff27f27915dc300*** Location: pittsburgh *** Time: 2017-10-07", "PhattybootyT-Girl - t4m - missed connections *** Looking for hookup �generous dudesin Harlem area�(Sixtyfive$�HalfHour) (Eighty$�Hour) (Onehundredthirty$ 1/hours) depends on youholla at me ☎☎ Sixfoursix#ninethreetwo#eightyfoursevennine *** 37047bc6e690eac5681cb80d8d16b2bc*** Location: newyork *** Time: 2017-10-07", "AMANDA who works at the grocery store in Mars - m4w - missed connections *** I went thru your line today....sweet boots on and great tits !
