The last ten years have been undoubtedly my best, so many happy memories they so far outweigh any of the rest.  A train wreck of an ending, tearing us apart, leaving not one, but two broken hearts. My feelings were always genuine, even when mistakes were made, and you know this to be true.  I looked you in the eyes when I said I love you.  I hope this isn't game for you, in the end with only losers all the same.  Our end come and gone, both of us still hurting and placing blame.  Though time will heal the hurt...it doesn't change my true love for you.  I wish you all the best for you, you are a beautiful amazing woman.  Over ten years you raised the bar so high I doubt it will ever be met.  By the end of this you know it's the real me.  Together or not, my love for you will be as true as can be.  Maybe when the anger fades, and I'm sure it will take a while...maybe when we see each other in the future we can remember all the good times and smile.Forever and Always, Whether you believe me or not, Love, J", "title": "RE: don't miss u - w4m - missed connections", "hash": "0df1043d0d43cd120f567c696c1f4ac6", "location": "raleigh", "time": "2017-12-22"},{"body": "And I've emailed you 3 different times to meet me face to face,  pussy.But you'll just bark your queerdom  from behind your cum  stained keyboard.Shut the fuck up, pussy.", "title": "ReX3 Moronburgh - missed connections", "hash": "78c826b608329233d539d04dc13e6a84", "location": "pittsburgh", "time": "2017-12-22"},{"body": "Black hat w peirced  ears black jeans White or Latin you were w another dude Damn yourfine hit me up I stay right around the corner you checked your self in the van is that yours", "title": "Out front of Pizza Hut - m4m - missed connections", "hash": "896ef476a414968519b4112889898fce", "location": "raleigh", "time": "2017-12-22"},{"body": "You: Redhead long hair, glasses, I think a Delta uniform.Me: Balding, black jacket, jeans.I think that we kept meeting eyes.

It's pretty common nowadays to see an asian girl with a guy of another race, right? So when you see a pair, no big deal. You, dear Reader, probably even know a few couples.2. Mixed asian kids are still a rare sight to see these days, right? So when you see one, it's still pretty surprising and interesting.I am sure you won't disagree with those two statements. Ok good. Now put those together in your mind. Do you see what that means? This: The vast majority of these guys don't stick around. Ok, another thought exercise for you-3. 99% of guys look at porn. Especially now with the internet offering everything for free.4. The biggest subcategory of pornography after plain white girl sex features asian actresses (hailing mostly from economically downtrodden Hawaii- but that's another topic).5. The biggest industry (really almost the only industry) outside of Western porn, is Japan'sYou know what I'm about to say next- put these three statements together. That's right, 99% of guys have therefore seen Asian porn. 99% of guys out there have thought of banging an Asian girl. 'But...no, not my guy, he's different,' you're thinking. Is he though? Ask yourself, do you think he has seen pornography? Ask yourself, why are there SO many guys are there looking for Asian women- the varied range of adolescents to old, elderly men (ok, I won't mention the pedophiles who go to Thailand), from the preppy guy, to rough around the edges guy, to the dorky nerd- is there one point of commonality among all of them? (whispers) It's porn.

When we met I was in a relationship and so were you.  Since then you moved on to someone else and I stayed with mine until the last 2 years.  Now, you just recently had a baby and you're relationship is suffering and life isn't very easy for you right now.  It breaks my heart.  Over the past few months I have been overcome with feelings for you.  Feelings that I haven't experienced in a long long time.  I did not always have feelings for you, as a matter of fact, at one point I disliked you very much, which is how I know that they are real.  I would never want to make you feel uncomfortable at your place of employment so I haven't told you about these feelings I have for you (you are one of the most perceptive people that I know so I'll bet you already know this) I just joke and hopefully innocently flirt from time to time.  I am also fairly certain that you have no feelings for me.  I think that what you have been used to is immature guys that just want you because you are beautiful and not because they actually love and know how you should be treated everyday.  Real love is strengthened through hardships.  When you care about someone you do whatever it takes to support that person.  By you're own admission you have never met a man that has been able to put you, and now you're daughter, first in life.  I want a chance to show you how a guy, that I think has his shit together, can not only make everyday life fun but help when needed.  You're independent attitude as a woman is a lot of the reason that I'm attracted to you and I am not looking to change that.  I welcome the challenges in life and am willing to lose sleep WITH you.  I am a very realistic person and do not expect you to just start dating me given all the stuff going on in your life right now.  I just wish that you would open you're life to me and let me prove that you AND HER can be the most important people in the room.  If given a chance, starting out just communicating and maybe letting me offer you some much needed help is fine with me.  I doubt you will find this, but if you do, think about it, I have a lot to offer.  If you do find this and the answer is no, I am mature and professional enough to not make it a problem for you.  I care about you a lot and if that means walking away, I will.  I just pray every morning and night that I don't have to.

(oh, crap...a spontaneous essay. *Some* things never change...sigh.)footnote first:**...** = I know what you'll think of, but that is not metaphorical. There are no metaphors employed herein, not by me, nor are there any attempts at doublespeak, casual code, or other efforts to pretend I'm saying something I'm not. That's not my department..............................Before I go:Why did you(s) come looking/calling out for me, in particular, after (throughout?) so many years?Moreover, why do you(s?) want me to 'know' so much (insofar as I can suss it out, anyway... which can't be impressing you(s) all that much, I'm sure)?Did I harm you(s) in some way? I don't like causing harm to people (or anything else, for that matter) so I hope not. If I did, that merits (real, face to face) discussion (to paraphrase myself ;-) ). If that's what is needed, please inquire.I'm hoping for genuine, sincere, human answers to these questions, but certainly not counting on them.I wish you(s) well... I wish everyone - all of us, everwhere in this wacky, troubled world - well. Maybe someday you'll come to feel the same way; maybe not...and if you(s) can't or won't get there, I'm sad for that. Smart as you(s) be, the world is missing out on the awesome force for good you(s) could be.(tl;dr, as the kids say - take a no-doz now or close the window; here comes the navel-gazing and pontificating)As for the paradoxical nature of 'love' vs. 'in love' (not that I think anyone was asking Me, necessarily; the reference just made me think about it):When, for whatever reason, a person realizes they're at odds with/unsure of their self-concept, they may also realize that 'in love' is not a reliable state of mind, much as one might believe they feel it. When a person comes to terms with the fact that they don't/haven't/no longer know their 'self' very well, they may see that it's hard to know anyone else well, thus 'in love' isn't a feeling you can interpret with any accuracy while in that state.So:  When I was in that place, back-then - **self-aware but without self-mastery** - I felt...no, I *decided* - even though I didn't necessarily want to...that just loving, in the purest sense I could manage while consciously setting aside the implicit needfulness of 'in love', was the most fair and right thing for both of us/everyone.I could not control my feelings of love, but I could control *how* to feel them, their **execution**, if you will.In short:  If I could not bring my best self (to you) , I should not go, nor ask anyone (you) to go with me/ask me to come...and at that time, I couldn't...so I didn't. I really did wish I could, though, at the time - more than almost anything - but it wouldn't have been right or healthy, even if you had wanted it, which I heard you to say you did not, and believed you to be truthful.It was three more years before I believed I had enough personal, inward clarity - and enough confidence in my ability to  be outwardly clear-eyed -  to allow myself to approach/be approached by someone for an intimate relationship. It has worked out well, with few bumps, relatively speaking, and I'm happy with the outcome. I love him very much, and he loves me, and we accept each other, flaws and all. In-love waxes and wanes, love stays steady, it's wonderfully quiet and peacefully dull (usually...grrrr!!!).That's the short view of my personal experience, anyway, with the differences and the overlappings. Can't speak for anyone else.That place on the hill, where we went the night we met? It was torn down years ago, replaced by some chain behemoth.
