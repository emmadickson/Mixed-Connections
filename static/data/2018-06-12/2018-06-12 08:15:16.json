Theres some things that where never cleared about us? But anyways was nice knowing you for them few months and THANKYOU for showing me how to be a adult. Like somethings ive said in the past was just wrong and i honestly NEVER ment it. I always said that stuff to see if u would come running back. But never did. I really do miss you and my bussiness is close to your house so when i drive by i always think of you and the kids. Anyways take care and hope your doing well s.m.p.", "location": "pittsburgh", "time": "2018-06-12", "hash":"8c7f16d92e196c7e1e6635859ee54402"}]}
