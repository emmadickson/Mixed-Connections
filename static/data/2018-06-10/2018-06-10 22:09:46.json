Today around 1 pm on the uptown local 6 train you got on around 23rd I think. You were wearing jeans, a white t shirt, a fedora and were covered in tattoos. You had a swallow tattoo on your neck. You sat next to me and then let a woman sit in your seat (what a gentleman). I was the blonde in shorts and black tank top with her hair up and glasses on with leg tattoos (I know I looked like a potato sack, sorry, I was going to pick up my check from work off 77th). When you got off (on 68th hunter college) you looked back through the window and smiled at me. I wish I asked for your number. Not sure if you'll EVER see this but, oh well. It's worth a shot.", "location": "newyork", "time": "2018-06-10", "hash":"279ae79b53cce87e9321f1d5bf2c9fd7"},{ "title": "let's have a beer - missed connections" , "body": "After reconnecting 10 years later,you still make me crazy!
