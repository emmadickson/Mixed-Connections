{"posts":[{ "title": "KAREN THOMAS-BUENO - missed connections" , "body": "You were billed as The Georgia Peach. You worked at the Gaity Theatre when it was a strip club in 1971. We met when a car rear-ended my car in front of the theatre. You ran over and diffused a fight. We saw each other a few times after that. Just wondering if you are still alive. I moved down to Miami soon after, and lost touch. I remember you were friends with Brandy Stevens, who I ran into in Miami Beach in the fall of 1971.", "location": "newyork", "time": "2018-06-14", "hash":"4dccd7bc5e9986930113a9983feeb331"}]}
